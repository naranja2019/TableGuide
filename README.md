# TableGuide

**TableGuide: A Stepwise-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning Framework for Large-Scale Table QA**
For reproduction of Large-Scale Table QA results in our paper, see instructions below.

## Overview

This repository provides the code implementation for TableGuide, a stepwise-guided retrieval and reasoning framework designed for large-scale Table-based Question Answering (QA). TableGuide aims to improve table-based QA tasks by combining table retrieval and reasoning steps in a structured manner. The framework leverages state-of-the-art models and methods to efficiently process tabular data and answer complex questions that require deep reasoning across tables.
